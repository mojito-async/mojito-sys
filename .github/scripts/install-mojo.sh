# .github/scripts/install-mojo.sh — install the Mojo toolchain on a CI
# runner. Ported verbatim from mojito-async's script of the same name
# (issue mojito-async/mojito-async#169: mojito-sys had no CI at all, so
# nothing here installed a toolchain either), then given the same
# nightly-channel default as mojito-async/mojito-async#181.
#
# The dev host installs Mojo through the mojito/brew tap, whose formula pulls
# the toolchain straight from Modular's conda channel and unpacks it into
# libexec.  That formula is arm64/macOS only, so this script does the same
# three steps directly and picks the right channel subdirectory per platform,
# which is what lets the Linux lane exist at all.
#
# The .conda archive is a zip containing a pkg-*.tar.zst payload.  The
# toolchain bakes its build-machine prefix into share/max/modular.cfg and the
# driver resolves std/compilerrt through it, so the prefix has to be
# rewritten after unpacking exactly as the formula does.
#
# CI runs every Mojo lane against Modular's max-nightly channel by default,
# same reasoning as the mojolang-nightly Homebrew formula and the mojito-async
# counterpart of this script: mojito-sys is mid-migration to Mojo-first and
# wants to see a nightly compiler regression here before it reaches anyone
# building against a released toolchain. Set MOJO_CHANNEL=max to run a lane
# against the stable channel instead.
#
# Nightly filenames roll roughly daily (mojo-compiler-<date-stamped
# version>-release.conda), so there is no fixed version to pin the way the
# stable formula does — MOJO_VERSION, when unset on the nightly channel,
# resolves to whatever repodata.json currently reports as newest. Set
# MOJO_VERSION explicitly to pin a reproducible nightly build instead. This
# resolution runs before the issue #169 cache check below so a cache hit is
# still keyed on the actual version, not an empty placeholder — and it still
# costs a network round trip on a cache hit, which is the point: a nightly
# channel should notice a newer build exists even when yesterday's is cached.
