# .github/scripts/install-mojo.sh — install the Mojo toolchain on a CI
# runner. Ported verbatim from mojito-async's script of the same name
# (issue mojito-async/mojito-async#169: mojito-sys had no CI at all, so
# nothing here installed a toolchain either), then given the same
# nightly-channel default as mojito-async/mojito-async#181.
#
# The dev host installs Mojo through the mojito/brew tap, whose formula pulls
# the toolchain straight from Modular's conda channel and unpacks it into
# libexec.  That formula is arm64/macOS only, so this script does the same
# three steps directly and picks the right channel subdirectory per platform,
# which is what lets the Linux lane exist at all.
#
# The .conda archive is a zip containing a pkg-*.tar.zst payload.  The
# toolchain bakes its build-machine prefix into share/max/modular.cfg and the
# driver resolves std/compilerrt through it, so the prefix has to be
# rewritten after unpacking exactly as the formula does.
#
# CI defaults to Modular's max (stable) channel. mojito-async/mojito-async#181
# flipped this to max-nightly by default, reasoning CI should catch a nightly
# Mojo regression before it reaches a released toolchain -
# mojito-async/mojito-async#200 reverted that default: max-nightly's newest
# published build turned out to be a year-stale snapshot (2025-09-03,
# confirmed by this repo's own #161 investigation), and that snapshot broke
# nearly every Mojo-compiling lane in this repo's CI (t1-t14, s1-s3 all
# failed identically the one time the workflow ran to completion instead of
# getting cancelled by the next push). A channel that isn't actually
# publishing nightly builds gives no benefit for the cost of a broken
# toolchain. Set MOJO_CHANNEL=max-nightly to opt into that channel anyway
# (e.g. to periodically check whether Modular has resumed publishing to it)
# - worth revisiting, not abandoning outright.
#
# Nightly filenames roll roughly daily (mojo-compiler-<date-stamped
# version>-release.conda) when the channel is actually live, so there is no
# fixed version to pin the way the stable channel's default is — MOJO_VERSION,
# when unset on the nightly channel, resolves to whatever repodata.json
# currently reports as newest. Set MOJO_VERSION explicitly to pin a
# reproducible nightly build instead. This resolution runs before the issue
# #169 cache check below so a cache hit is still keyed on the actual
# version, not an empty placeholder — and it still costs a network round
# trip on a cache hit, which is the point: a nightly channel should notice a
# newer build exists even when yesterday's is cached.
