# .github/scripts/install-mojo.sh — install the pinned Mojo toolchain on a CI
# runner. Ported verbatim from mojito-async's script of the same name
# (issue mojito-async/mojito-async#169: mojito-sys had no CI at all, so
# nothing here installed a toolchain either).
#
# The dev host installs Mojo through the mojito/brew tap, whose formula pulls
# the toolchain straight from Modular's conda channel and unpacks it into
# libexec.  That formula is arm64/macOS only, so this script does the same
# three steps directly and picks the right channel subdirectory per platform,
# which is what lets the Linux lane exist at all.
#
# The .conda archive is a zip containing a pkg-*.tar.zst payload.  The
# toolchain bakes its build-machine prefix into share/max/modular.cfg and the
# driver resolves std/compilerrt through it, so the prefix has to be
# rewritten after unpacking exactly as the formula does.
