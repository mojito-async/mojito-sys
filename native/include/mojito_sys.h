 * mojito-sys S1 — frozen C ABI (issue #24): page / VM / stack services.
 *
 * S1 contract:
 *   - Live stack addresses never move. Once a stack region is allocated and
 *     committed, its usable range is stable for the lifetime of the binding;
 *     mjs_stack_free returns it wholesale. (No stack growth/shrink in S1.)
 *   - Every stack region carries guard_bytes (a POSITIVE page multiple) of
 *     PROT_NONE at the LOW end of the reservation (below *out_guard_low).
 *     Crossing it is a hard fault by design. guard_bytes == 0 or a non-page
 *     multiple is an error (-EINVAL).
 *   - Compatibility: the signatures and semantics below are frozen for the
 *     S1 milestone. Extending the ABI means adding new names, never changing
 *     these declarations. The ABI version is MOJITO_SYS_ABI_VERSION.
 *   - mjs_page_size / mjs_granularity are informational. Byte counts passed
 *     to commit/decommit/protect must be positive page multiples by the
 *     caller (validated where cheap; undefined results otherwise).
 *   - Concurrency: these primitives are NOT thread-safe on a shared region.
 *     A reservation/stack region is single-owner; serialize concurrent use
 *     of the same region (or its cursor) by the caller.
 *
 * Return-value contract (all entry points):
 *   0 == success; negative == -errno (e.g. -ENOMEM, -EINVAL, -EFAULT).
 *   Out-parameters are UNTOUCHED on failure.

 *   and wakes at most one parked waiter; when no one waits the token
 *   STICKS so exactly one later wait completes without blocking.
 *   Signals issued while a token is already pending COALESCE: five
 *   signals with no waiter release exactly one future wait. A
 *   successful wait/wait_until CONSUMES the token; every other waiter
 *   keeps sleeping until the next signal. Fairness is not promised:
 *   a fresh arrival may consume the token ahead of an already-woken
 *   waiter that has not yet reacquired the internal mutex.
 *
 * Handle lifetime: identical to the s3-mutex / s3-condvar model —

 * IMPLEMENTATION COMPOSITION + FUTURE FAST PATH: this layer composes
 * the portable s3-mutex + s3-condvar primitives (one internal mutex,
 * one internal condvar pinned per the s3-condvar clock domain, one
 * int token). The atomic-wait layer has landed on main (#59/#60); the
 * uncontended fast path slots into exactly two places WITHOUT changing
 * this ABI:
 *   - wait/wait_until: an atomic acquire-load of the token short-
 *     circuits the mutex+condvar park when a token is already visible;
 *     the slow path becomes mjs_atomic_wait_u32(&e->token, 0, ...).
 *   - signal: store-release of the token plus
 *     mjs_atomic_wake_u32_one(&e->token) replaces the internal
 *     lock/cv_signal pair.

 * accounting among the sync primitives but leaves breadth open; this
 * ABI pins them): NativeSemaphore is a COUNTING semaphore holding a
 * NON-NEGATIVE permit count.
 *   - mjs_sem_post releases ONE permit: increments the count and wakes
 *     AT MOST ONE parked waiter. With nobody waiting the permit stays
 *     resident for a later wait, and permits ACCUMULATE — N posts with
 *     no waiter leave N permits, so exactly N later waits complete
 *     without blocking (a counting semaphore, NOT NativeEvent's
 *     coalescing signal).
 *   - mjs_sem_wait acquires ONE permit: it blocks while the count is
 *     zero, then decrements it. Each permit is consumed by EXACTLY ONE
 *     wait; permits are conserved across posts and waits.
 *   - mjs_sem_wait_until is the bounded form: absolute monotonic
 *     deadline in ns (same domain as mjs_clock_now; platform clock
 *     mapping lives in the composed mjs_condvar — Linux condattr
 *     CLOCK_MONOTONIC, macOS relative-NP remainder). EXPIRY PARITY:
 *     a waiter that observes -ETIMEDOUT re-checks the permit count
 *     before returning; a permit visible at that re-check is CONSUMED
 *     and 0 returned — wake beats timeout, exactly like
 *     mjs_event_wait_until and mjs_atomic_wait_on_u32.
 *   - mjs_sem_try_wait acquires WITHOUT blocking: 0 once a permit was
 *     taken, -EBUSY (a STATUS like try_lock's) when the count is zero,
 *     another negative on error.
 *   - The count NEVER goes negative: an acquisition that would take it
 *     below zero instead blocks (wait/wait_until) or returns -EBUSY
 *     (try_wait). Fairness is NOT promised: a fresh arrival may acquire
 *     a permit ahead of an already-woken waiter that has not yet
 *     reacquired the internal mutex.
 *
 * Handle lifetime: identical to the s3-mutex / s3-condvar / s3-event
 * model — mjs_sem_init yields an owned opaque handle in *out;
 * mjs_sem_destroy CONSUMES it (*s NULLed on success); any use of a
 * consumed or NULL handle is a deterministic -EINVAL. Destroying a
 * semaphore while threads still wait on it is a caller bug (undefined);
 * the caller must join its waiters first.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION COMPOSITION: this layer composes the portable s3.1 +
 * s3.2 primitives (one internal mjs_mutex, one internal mjs_condvar
 * pinned per the s3-condvar clock domain, one int count), exactly like
 * the s3-event and the AtomicWait-macOS-fallback precedent.
 *
 * Blocking (SYS-5): wait/wait_until block the calling OS thread until a
 *   permit is available or the deadline expires; post wakes but never
 *   waits; try_wait never blocks (returns -EBUSY on an empty
 *   semaphore); init/destroy block only insofar as malloc and the
 *   composed pthread primitives do.
 * Allocation (SYS-4): one fixed-size handle at init; NONE afterwards.
 * Task-aware: no — OS-thread granularity per spec §14.

 * S5.1 native contexts (issue #64, spec §20.2): stackful cooperative
 * contexts switched at the callee-saved register level. Same additive-
 * only regime as every block above; MOJITO_SYS_ABI_VERSION stays 1.
 *
 * Return-value contract: ms_context_init is the ONLY errno-style entry
 * point in this block (0 == success; negative == -errno). It takes no
 * out-parameters; on failure the caller's context storage is left
 * untouched (uninitialized). capture/switch/destroy are void and cannot
 * fail.
 *
 * Context storage: a context is CALLER-OWNED storage of
 * ms_context_size() bytes with ms_context_alignment() alignment (a
 * struct member, heap block, or stack slot all work). The library never
 * allocates, moves, or frees it.
 *
 * Frozen v2 save-area layout (amendment #19 — panel-proven after silent
 * numeric-frame corruption without d8-d15 saves): Backend-pinned via
 * _Static_asserts in ms_context.c — INTERNAL to the library,
 * informational here, not a consumer promise; kept for the S5.2 ELF
 * port. Register-level backends address these slots directly. What is
 * pinned here is the frozen v2 PREFIX; the #66 lifecycle tail appends a
 * 4-slot v3 TAIL after it (168-byte prefix + 4 x uint64_t = 200 bytes
 * total; see the Lifecycle paragraph below):
 *   v2 prefix — 168 bytes:
 *     regs[12] @   0.. 95  x19..x28, fp(x29) @80, lr(x30) @88
 *     fps[8]   @  96..159  low 64 bits of v8..v15 (d8..d15)
 *     sp       @ 160       saved stack pointer
 * x86-64 restore-time trap #0x6b: besides the shared misuse classes, the
 * x86-64 SysV backend ALSO traps (int3, %eax marker #0x6b) if a context's
 * saved sp slot is not 16-byte aligned when a switch is about to restore
 * it — SysV requires rsp ≡ 0 (mod 16) at callee entry, so a misaligned
 * slot is corruption caught BEFORE the bad stack is committed (mirrors
 * the make-time #0x64 class; the AArch64 backend's restore path has no
 * alignment trap because its initial-sp invariant is enforced at make).
 *
 * BACKEND SUPPORT STATUS (x86-64 SysV, read loudly): NOT
 * NativeContext-supported yet. Native support requires FULL 128-bit
 * preservation of the entire SysV callee-saved SIMD set — xmm14/xmm15 are
 * still omitted because the frozen fps bank holds only 8 low-64 slots
 * (SysV diverges from AAPCS64 here) — plus a passing in-repo conformance
 * suite (spec §38.6). Until then the x86-64 SysV backend is a
 * cross-assembled structural mirror only (assembles cleanly on this host;
 * behavioral rows are RED-EXCLUDED UNSUPPORTED-PLATFORM until a
 * Linux/x86_64 runner exists — tests/s5/x86).
 * Synthetic entry: ms_context_init prepares ctx so its first resume
 * lands on an internal trampoline that calls entry(userdata) with a
 * 16-byte-aligned sp (AAPCS64 at function entry). userdata is passed
 * through UNMODIFIED. When entry returns, the trampoline's completion
 * stage runs — the registered finish hook (see
 * ms_context_set_finish_hook), then the record is marked FINISHED —
 * and control switches PERMANENTLY back to the most recent switcher
 * of ctx; resuming a finished or destroyed context traps loudly
 * (deliberate hard trap, not -errno).
 *
 * Lifecycle (#66): every context RECORD owns its own state machine —
 * DEAD (zeroed storage) / EMPTY (armed by init or capture) / RUNNING
 * (currently executing) / SUSPENDED (mid-life, resumable) / FINISHED
 * (entry returned) — plus its own return target. There is NO global
 * bookkeeping: any number of live contexts may exist simultaneously
 * (the spike-era 64-context return-to-table limit is gone).
 *
 * Thread-safety (#66): PER-CONTEXT exclusivity. The caller serializes
 * concurrent operations on the SAME context (one OS thread at a time
 * per context); distinct contexts are thread-INDEPENDENT — no shared
 * mutable state remains in the library — so they may be created,
 * switched, and finished concurrently on different threads without
 * locking. Resuming a context another thread currently holds RUNNING
 * traps loudly rather than corrupting. NULL context/entry arguments
 * are caller bugs where the signature cannot report them (void entry
 * points).
 *
 * Blocking (SYS-5): all of these are non-blocking. Allocation (SYS-4):

/*
 * S6.4 epoll lifecycle (issue #76, spec §27.1/§28/§31/§38.7).
 * Same return-value contract as the s6-poller block: 0 == success;
 * negative == -errno; out-params UNTOUCHED on failure.
 *
 * BACKEND GUARD: epoll is LINUX-ONLY. Hosts without epoll (darwin, BSD,
 * Windows) return EXACTLY -ENOSYS from every entry point
 * (detect-and-exclude, mirroring the s6-poller kqueue contract) so the
 * packaged dylib builds everywhere; the Mojo EpollPoller raises a decoded
 * unsupported-platform error.
 *
 * Interests and events ship in one neutral bitmask:
 *   MJS_POLL_READABLE / MJS_POLL_WRITABLE are REGISTERABLE interests;
 *   MJS_POLL_EOF / MJS_POLL_ERROR are EVENT-ONLY flags, never accepted
 *   as interests (-EINVAL when passed to register/modify).
 *
 * Trigger doctrine (spec §29 kept below the platform-neutral wrapper;
 * §38.7 epoll-specific): this backend exposes LEVEL-triggered semantics
 * by default — a ready fd is reported on every wait until the caller
 * drains it. EPOLLET (edge) and EPOLLONESHOT are deliberately NOT
 * exposed through the frozen ABI (documented exclusions; a reactor that
 * needs edge selects it inside mojito-async, not here).
 *
 * Duplicate registration / modify: re-registering a live descriptor is an
 * UPSERT via EPOLL_CTL_MOD — the LAST register/modify wins for BOTH
 * interests and token. unregister of a not-registered descriptor
 * succeeds (0); only real kernel errors (-errno) fail, so unregister/
 * reuse races degrade to no-ops, never errors.
 *
 * Token: completely opaque identity (spec §31); preserved EXACTLY through
 * every delivered event (64-bit value travels verbatim in
 * epoll_event.data.u64).
 *
 * Wake: mjs_epoll_wake writes one 64-bit value on the internal eventfd
 * (create pre-registers it for EPOLLIN). A wake makes at most ONE blocked
 * wait return promptly; a wake with NO waiter STICKS so exactly one later
 * wait returns promptly. N wakes with no waiter still release exactly ONE
 * wait (the drained counter condenses to a single release). wake NEVER
 * blocks (SYS-5); only wait parks its calling OS thread, bounded by
 * timeout_ns.
 *
 * wait status mapping:
 *   0        — success; *out_n carries 0..cap events (0 == timeout);
 *              wake deliveries NEVER occupy an out slot but DO end the
 *              wait early (possibly with *out_n == 0);
 *   -EINTR   — interrupted before any event: raw -EINTR, caller retries
 *               (§38.11 interrupt/retry doctrine);
 *   other    — genuine error, negative -errno verbatim.
 * Events beyond cap are DROPPED (callers loop). cap == 0 is -EINVAL.
 *
 * EOF/error delivery (§38.7 epoll-specific): EPOLLRDHUP or EPOLLHUP sets
 * MJS_POLL_EOF; EPOLLERR sets MJS_POLL_ERROR; readiness bits OR in when
 * present.
 *
 * Handle lifetime: create yields an owned opaque handle in *out; close
 * CONSUMES it (**p NULLed on success). Any use of a consumed or NULL
 * handle is a deterministic -EINVAL. The poller is NON-OWNING: closing
 * it never closes registered descriptors (spec §25 borrow rule). Closing
 * a REGISTERED descriptor silently retires its epoll entry (Linux drops
 * it on close); no event fires, later waits report nothing.
 *
 * Blocking (SYS-5): ONLY mjs_epoll_wait may block (bounded by timeout_ns
 * when non-NULL); register/modify/unregister/wake/close never block.
 * Allocation (SYS-4): one fixed-size handle at create; NONE afterwards
 * (the epoll_event batch lives on this file's stack).
 * Task-aware: no — OS-thread granularity per spec §14.

 * io_uring (e.g. Darwin) return EXACTLY -ENOSYS from every entry point that
 * requires a live ring (detect-and-exclude, mirroring the s6-poller kqueue
 * block); mjs_iouring_probe/available return 0 there.
 *
 * The interests/event bitmask and the mjs_poll_event wire format are shared

 * preserved EXACTLY in delivered events (§31). EOF/error map from POLLHUP
 * -> MJS_POLL_EOF and POLLERR -> MJS_POLL_ERROR.
 *
 * Wake: mjs_iouring_wake makes at most ONE blocked wait return 0 events. A
 * wake with no waiter STICKS (the eventfd byte stays pending for exactly
 * one later wait). wake NEVER blocks (SYS-5); only mjs_iouring_wait parks

 * provider: it paints a PROT_NONE guard page at the low end and returns
 * guard_low), and growth is the top-down descent over the range the
 * owner has COMMITTED (mjs_vm_commit / NativeStack.grow). Crossing the
 * guard floor faults synchronously at the faulting store
 * (SIGBUS/SIGSEGV) — the library never installs the guard, never
 * mprotects caller storage, and never soft-grows (SYS-4, ADR-SYS-005).
 *
 * The library enforces what it can without an ABI change (the record
 * stays 200 bytes; the v3 lifecycle tail is fully allocated):
 *   - ms_context_init rejects stack_low/size combinations that wrap
 *     (stack_top overflow, -EINVAL);
 *   - the switch backend traps (brk #0x6b) on a restored sp that is
 *     NOT 16-aligned (AAPCS64) BEFORE sp goes live — a poisoned or
 *     corrupt record can never resume into a wild stack pointer;
 *   - recorded bounds enforcement (sp inside the committed span) is
 *     the OWNER's job at dispatch: read the saved sp slot (@160) and
 *     reject to->sp < owner_floor || to->sp > top before switching.
 * Unguarded static-buffer reservations remain accepted for tests and
 * compatibility; overflow on them is documented caller error, never a
 * library promise.
